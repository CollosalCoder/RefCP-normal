# RefCP-normal
Just a place where I keep all my syntax related stuff plus exceptions. It might need updations to it and I welcome any suggestions and improvements. I am new and would update whenever possible.
# Notes: 
Regarding comparison of time efficiency to solve problems, whether to use inbuilt functions and traversal while using a data type like sets especially ordered sets which maintain balanced binary trees which in case of solving simpler tasks increase result time whereas sorting slgorithm of same complexity can be as fast as 10 times faster for the same task in given constraints.
